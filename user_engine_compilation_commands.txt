To compile the .pt file to tensorRT .engine files use the following commands:

Compilation of the yolov5:
python3 yolov5/export.py --weights yolov5/best.pt --device 0 --include engine

Compilation of the tracker:
python3 trackers/reid_export.py --device 0 --weights weights/osnet_x0_25_msmt17.pt --include engine --dynamic --batch-size 50

Notes:
    - in each line, the first argument refers to the export script, and the weights argument refers to the .pt weights file respectively
